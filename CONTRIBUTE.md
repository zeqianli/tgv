# Contribution is welcome

I don't write Rust at all for work and this started as a hobby project. There is so much I want to build! I believe this tool can be a big as IGV one day.

Please join the [discord](https://discord.gg/NKGg684M) to discuss ideas!

The focus now is user experience: ship new features, squash bugs, ensure scientific accuracy, and learn the community need. I want to focus on features that most people actually want. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for some ideas.

Performance is secondary for now. It runs smooth although being very underoptimized (e.g [read processing](https://github.com/zeqianli/tgv/blob/main/src/models/alignment.rs); the app runs on an async runtime but don't actually use it.)

I'm unfamiliar with many fields (e.g. single-cell, RNA, long-read). If you can propose critical needs for these fields, please do!

I intend to publish as well (see [similar tools](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/10/1568/2949507)) and want to share authorship with major contributors.
